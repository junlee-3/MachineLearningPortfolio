# IT Machine Learning Portfolio

This portfolio showcases three key projects that demonstrate my understanding and application of various machine learning techniques. The projects included are Image Classification, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Linear Regression.

## Projects

### 1. Image Classification using Tensorflow
This project involves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into different categories. The dataset used consists of labeled images, and the goal is to train a model that can accurately predict the category of new, unseen images of clothing.

**Key Features:**
- **Dataset:** Labeled images.
- **Model:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
- **Outcome:** High accuracy in image classification, with successful generalization to new data.

### 2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification
This project demonstrates the KNN algorithm to classify data points based on their nearest neighbors. The dataset used includes various car attributes, such as buying price, maintenance cost, doors, persons capacity, luggage boot size, safety, and car class. The goal was to predict the car's class based on these attributes.

**Key Code Highlights:**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Label encoding was used to convert categorical data into numerical values for model compatibility.
- **Model:** The KNN model was trained and tested with a specified number of neighbors (`k=9`).
- **Performance Evaluation:** A confusion matrix was generated to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions, achieving an overall accuracy of approximately 96.5%. The matrix provided insights into areas where the model excelled and where it could improve.

### 3. Linear Regression
The Linear Regression project involved predicting the Initial Spread Index (ISI) of forest fires based on other factors such as the Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC), temperature, and wind speed. The goal was to find the line of best fit that could accurately predict ISI values.

**Key Code Highlights:**
- **Data Preprocessing:** Selected relevant features and split the dataset into training and test sets.
- **Model:** A linear regression model was trained on the dataset, and the coefficients and intercept of the line of best fit were calculated.
- **Performance:** The model's accuracy was evaluated, and predictions were generated and compared with actual values to assess the model's reliability.
